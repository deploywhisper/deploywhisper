# Story 12.7: Backup, Restore, Upgrade, and Retention Docs

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Generated from updated PRD/architecture/epics plus implementation-readiness-report-2026-05-01.md. -->

## Story

As a DeployWhisper user,
I want operational docs for data lifecycle,
So that I can run DeployWhisper safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a self-hosted operator reads operations docs, When they plan backup, restore, upgrade, retention, logs, or database maintenance, Then supported SQLite and PostgreSQL paths are documented. And examples avoid exposing secrets.

### Requirement Traceability

- Primary PRD requirements: Epic 12 coverage: ADM-01..02, NFR-SEC-01..07, NFR-OPS-01..06, GOV-06..07, DOC-11, DOC-12.
- Supporting PRD / NFR / differentiation requirements: See `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`, `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`, and `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/implementation-readiness-report-2026-05-01.md`.
- Coverage intent: Baseline + Delta.
- Story alignment note: This story was created from the updated Epic 12 plan after the 2026-05-01 readiness rerun. The readiness report verified 187/187 PRD functional requirement IDs in the epics artifact, 38 NFR IDs present, and no critical or major readiness defects.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement and verify acceptance criterion 1. (AC: 1)
- [ ] Reuse existing services, repositories, schemas, and UI/CLI/API helpers before adding new abstractions. (AC: all)
- [ ] Add or update deterministic regression coverage for the changed behavior. (AC: all)
- [ ] Update relevant docs or examples if the story changes user-visible, operator, API, CLI, integration, or contribution behavior. (AC: all)
- [ ] Run required validation and record commands/results in the Dev Agent Record. (AC: all)

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

- Epic: 12. Security and Supply Chain Hardening
- Epic goal: Make the project trustworthy to install, operate, and contribute to.
- Epic coverage: ADM-01..02, NFR-SEC-01..07, NFR-OPS-01..06, GOV-06..07, DOC-11, DOC-12

### Architecture and Product Guardrails

- Preserve DeployWhisper's local-first raw artifact boundary: raw IaC, scanner artifacts, incident exports, and sensitive context stay in the user's infrastructure by default.
- Preserve the advisory-first core. Optional adapters may interpret report outputs, but canonical report semantics remain advisory unless explicit story scope says otherwise.
- Reuse the shared analysis core and service layer before adapting UI, API, CLI, GitHub, or future workflow surfaces.
- Keep Evidence Law behavior intact: no high or critical finding without deterministic evidence.
- Keep project/workspace scope explicit for reports, incidents, topology, outcomes, feedback, scanner imports, and connector-related data.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless the active story explicitly requires and justifies them.

### Source Tree Guidance

- API routes belong under `api/routes/` and should use existing `ApiRoute` / `ApiError` envelope patterns.
- Shared orchestration belongs in `services/`; parsers normalize input, analysis modules score/derive risk, and surfaces adapt outputs.
- UI work belongs under `frontend/src/screens/` and `frontend/src/components/`, following the React SPA theme/UI primitives and approved design mockup. Validate any browser-facing change against the Compose-built FastAPI app, not Vite.
- CLI behavior belongs under `cli/` and must call the same service-layer paths as UI/API flows.
- Persistence work belongs under `models/` with Alembic migrations when schema changes are required.
- Documentation required by a story should be updated in the same workstream.

### Testing Requirements

- Use standard-library `unittest` in the existing `tests/test_*` layout.
- Add focused regression tests for the layer changed by the story before broad refactors.
- For Python changes, run `./.venv/bin/ruff check .`, `./.venv/bin/ruff format --check .`, and `./.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -q` before closing implementation.
- Use `bash scripts/ci-local.sh` for broader or cross-layer changes.

### Project Structure Notes

- Follow the current repository shape documented in `_bmad-output/project-context.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- If implementation reveals a conflict between this story and the current code baseline, keep the smallest compatible change and update the story notes rather than silently drifting from the PRD.

## Change Log

- 2026-05-01: Story created/aligned from updated PRD, architecture, epics, sprint status, and readiness report.

## Release Baseline Reconciliation — 2026-10-07

Status remains `ready-for-dev`. Existing baseline credit: Release notes cover backup before migration and migration 028. Remaining acceptance: Complete tested backup/restore, upgrade/rollback and retention runbooks for supported deployments. No incomplete task is marked complete by release publication. See `../planning-artifacts/sprint-change-proposal-2026-10-07-v1.4.0-status-reconciliation.md`. UI validation is required only if subsequent implementation touches a browser surface; this reconciliation is documentation-only.
